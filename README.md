# Bank-Loan-Data-Analysis-Power-BI

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data through interactive Power BI dashboards to support data-driven lending decisions. The dashboards provide comprehensive insights into loan applications, funding performance, borrower behavior, and loan portfolio health, enabling stakeholders to make informed strategic decisions.

The solution addresses the limitations of traditional static reports by delivering dynamic visualizations and key performance indicators (KPIs) that highlight trends, risks, and performance metrics across multiple dimensions.

---

## Business Problem
Traditional loan data reporting lacks interactivity and depth, making it difficult to evaluate lending performance, borrower risk, and financial health effectively. Decision-makers require a unified, interactive view of loan operations to identify trends, assess portfolio risk, and optimize lending strategies.

This project bridges that gap by transforming raw loan data into actionable insights through advanced dashboard design and analytical modeling.

## Project Objectives
- Provide a holistic view of lending operations and loan performance
- Track critical KPIs such as loan applications, funded amount, amount received, interest rates, and DTI
- Analyze borrower behavior and risk patterns across regions, loan purposes, and employment history
- Enable data-driven decision-making through interactive and drill-down dashboards
